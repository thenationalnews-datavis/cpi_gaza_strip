# Consumer Price Index in the Gaza Strip

Every month, the [Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS)](https://www.pcbs.gov.ps/default.aspx) publishes the Consumer Price Index (CPI) in the Gaza Strip. The CPI measures the cost of living and the changes in the prices of goods and services purchased or acquired by households.

> [!NOTE]
>
> Baseline (2018 prices) = **100**
> 
> Values bigger than **100** :arrow_right: higher costs

The data is downloaded via the [Humanitarian Data Exchange (HDX)](https://data.humdata.org/) platform and it's under the name ["State of Palestine - Consumer Price Index](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/state-of-palestine-consumer-price-index).
